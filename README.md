###### DESCRIPTION

An academic project for a compilers course. The projects consists of a compiler of a stripped version of C. It outputs JVM code and uses JavaCC for the grammar and JJTree for creating an annotated parsing tree.

I probably won't be working on this project anymore, but since it was such a pain to develop (damn you teachers!! ) I decided to share it...

I will supply the built jar as soon as I can, and some test files so you can see it in action.

To compile it simply import into Netbeans.
